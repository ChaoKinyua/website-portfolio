        <h3>My career in tech</h3>
    <p>
        My career in technology has been driven by a focus on software development,
        data analysis, and machine learning. I work on building intelligent systems 
        that transform raw data into actionable insights—developing web applications, 
        predictive models, and automation tools that solve complex real-world problems.

        <br>I have applied machine learning to create models capable of predicting trends, 
        optimizing decision-making, and improving efficiency across various domains. 
        From exploring AI in agriculture and healthcare to designing smarter business solutions,
        I see machine learning as a powerful tool to create meaningful impact.

        <br>Beyond machine learning, I continue to expand my skills in cloud computing, 
        scalable applications, and modern software frameworks, with the goal of building 
        solutions that are innovative, accessible, and sustainable.tftdctyaegdcaebdycyedgcay

        <h3>My Career a Chemist</h3>
    
    <p>
        My career in chemistry has been shaped by a passion for analytical science and
        problem-solving. With a foundation in Analytical Chemistry, I have developed 
        strong expertise in laboratory techniques, data interpretation, and quality assurance. 
        My work has involved analyzing complex samples, developing accurate testing methods, 
        and ensuring compliance with scientific standards to support research and industry 
        needs.FFYVDVGD

       <br> I have also explored the role of chemistry in food science and technology, 
        particularly in understanding the chemical properties of food, improving safety, 
        and enhancing nutritional value. My experience extends to working in 
        research environments, where precision, innovation, and attention to detail are 
        critical in driving reliable outcomes.

        <br>As a chemist, I view science as a tool for both discovery and
        application—bridging theory with practice to solve pressing challenges in health, 
        environment, and industry. Looking forward, I aim to integrate my chemistry background 
        with emerging technologies to push the boundaries of research and innovation.
